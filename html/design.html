    <h3>m)Positining schemes:</h3>
    <h4>1)static in 110th line "default.css" and many more.<br>
        2)relative : 12th line in "homepage.css" and 80th line in "homepage.css" (used to align the borders with
        header).<br>
        3)fixed: 32nd line in "order.css" used it for fixing the footer (also used the media query for responsive
        layout).
    </h4>
    <h3>n)CSS3 techniques:</h3>
    <h4><span>1)Round corner</span>: 21st, 36th lines in "homepage.css".<br>
        Desc:<br>
        Made rounded corners for elements/divs (all of them actually rounded).<br>
        2)<span>Gradient</span>: 19th, 114th lines in "default.css".<br>
        Desc:<br>
        Made gradient text in the 19th line and gradient background for "Welcome!" message in 114th line.<br>
        3)<span>Animation</span>:17th, 123rd, 141st lines in "default.css".<br>
        Desc:<br>
        In the 17th line animated "DisneyLand" message so that the letters move like a wave when hovering(also the text
        color becomes gradient).<br>
        In the 123rd line animated the "Welcome!" messages background to glow with different colors.<br>
        In the 141st line animated the DisneyLand logo to rotate for 13 degree when hovering.<br>
